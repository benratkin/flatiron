# Welcome to Ben Atkin's Flatiron School Repo!

If you're an HR representative and your company needs a data scientist, let me suggest a few school projects to start with:

**OR**

If you're serious and want to see the cool (but private) stuff, ask for access to two of my private repos:
https://github.com/benratkin/data_delta (Production ETL system implemented in AWS EC2; ingesting, cleaning and custom SQL logic to update 24 million rows per delta file)
https://github.com/benratkin/data_scraper (Production webscraping module on AWS EC2; scrape ~8,000 websites per day for rental vacancy data, transform and load to AWS RDS instance running PostgreSQL)
